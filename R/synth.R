#' Write fine-tuning data with a teacher model
#'
#' Sends each prompt to a stronger model and keeps its replies as the
#' responses to train on. This is the fastest way to get good training data
#' for a small model: a few hundred prompts from your domain, answered the
#' way you want them answered. A quality pass then drops rows that are too
#' short or too long, look garbled, repeat an earlier prompt, or repeat
#' (or nearly repeat) an earlier response, so a teacher's stock phrases
#' don't dominate the dataset. Passing a `judge` adds distillation with a
#' quality gate: it scores every surviving reply and keeps only the ones at
#' or above `min_score`, the way you would with a teacher answering a
#' student's own prompts (see [dragon_prompts()]) and filtering out its
#' weaker answers. The result is saved as JSONL and returned as a mapped
#' dataset ready for [dragon_train()].
#'
#' @param prompts A character vector of prompts, or a mapped `dragon_dataset`
#'   whose prompt template is rendered for every row. See [dragon_prompts()]
#'   for prompts from an existing run, which is how distillation from "the
#'   model's own prompts" is done: pass `dragon_prompts(run, "train")`.
#' @param teacher The model that writes the replies: [dragon_llm_anthropic()],
#'   an `ellmer` chat, a model id or directory, a finished run, or any
#'   function from prompts to replies.
#' @param system System prompt for the teacher. Also stored with every row
#'   so the student trains with the same instruction.
#' @param max_new_tokens Reply length cap for local teachers.
#' @param temperature Sampling temperature for local teachers.
#' @param judge Optional. Scores every surviving reply from 1 to 10 and
#'   drops the ones below `min_score`. See [dragon_judge()] for what is
#'   accepted.
#' @param min_score Minimum judge score to keep a reply. Only used when
#'   `judge` is given.
#' @param rubric What the judge should value. See [dragon_judge()].
#' @param dedupe Drop rows whose prompt repeats an earlier one, and rows
#'   whose response exactly or nearly repeats an earlier response (see
#'   `near_dup_threshold`).
#' @param near_dup_threshold Word-overlap similarity (0 to 1) above which
#'   two responses count as near-duplicates. Lower catches more; `1`
#'   disables near-duplicate detection while leaving exact-duplicate
#'   detection on.
#' @param min_chars,max_chars Keep only replies whose length in characters
#'   falls in this range.
#' @param min_alpha_ratio Minimum share of printable ASCII characters in a
#'   reply; a crude filter for garbled output or a reply in the wrong
#'   script. `0` (the default) disables it; non-English replies need it
#'   left off or set low.
#' @param file Where to write the JSONL. Defaults to a timestamped file under
#'   `synth/` in `runs_dir`.
#' @param runs_dir Parent directory for the default `file`.
#' @param name Label used in the default file name.
#' @return A `dragon_dataset` mapped with prompt and response columns (and
#'   system, when given). The file path is its `source`, so [dragon_code()]
#'   reproduces runs trained on it. `attr(ds, "synthesis")$dropped` breaks
#'   down what the quality pass (and the judge, if used) removed.

#' Build preference pairs from a model's own samples
#'
#' Preference optimization needs, for each prompt, a better and a worse
#' reply. This function makes them without hand labelling, in one of two
#' ways:
#'
#' * With a `judge`: the student answers each prompt `n_samples` times at a
#'   non-zero temperature, the judge scores every sample from 1 to 10, and
#'   the best and worst become the chosen and rejected replies. Prompts whose
#'   samples are too close (`min_gap`) or identical are dropped. This is the
#'   loop behind RLAIF-style training: the model improves on its own outputs
#'   under a judge's preferences.
#' * With a `teacher`: the teacher's reply is chosen and the student's is
#'   rejected. Cheap and effective when the teacher is clearly stronger.
#'
#' The result is saved as JSONL and returned as a dataset mapped with

#'   is accepted. Required unless `teacher` is given.
